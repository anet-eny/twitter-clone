# Twitter Clone

Twitter Clone is a social media-inspired web application where users can view and interact with tweets. Users can like, retweet, delete, and comment on tweets. This project demonstrates dynamic rendering and interactive features in a web application. This project was developed as part of the Scrimba curriculum.

## Features

- **Tweet Viewing**: Users can view tweets, including the profile picture, handle, tweet text, and tweet details (like, retweet, delete icons).
- **Commenting**: Users can add comments to tweets by typing in the input field and pressing the Enter key or clicking the submit icon.
- **Likes and Retweets**: Users can like and retweet tweets, with the counts dynamically updating.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Tweets and their interactions are dynamically rendered based on data provided, allowing for a flexible and responsive user experience.

## Key Learnings

- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners for click and keydown events to handle user interactions like liking, retweeting, commenting, and deleting tweets.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Developed logic for dynamically rendering tweets and comments, including creating HTML elements and appending them to the DOM.
- **Data Management**: Managed tweet data using JavaScript objects, including updating likes, retweets, and comments.
- **Form Handling**: Implemented form handling for submitting comments using both the Enter key and a submit button.
